  <title>Raptor RDF Syntax Library - Upgrading to the Raptor V2 API</title>
</head>

  <h1>Raptor RDF Syntax Library - Upgrading to the Raptor V2 API</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Raptor V2 is a cleaned up version of the Raptor V1 API with
changes that include adding, removing and re-ordering parameters,
adding and removing return types as well as renaming the
functions.</p>

<p>The headers and libraries install to different places or names so
that Raptor V1 and Raptor V2 can both be present (including headers)
on the same system without clashing.  However, if you do try linking
the same binary with both, that won't work!   There are only two
installed files that overlap - the <code>rapper</code> utility
and it's manual page.
</p>


<h2>Configuration and compiling changes</h2>

<p>Raptor V2 uses <code>pkg-config(1)</code> to provide the compile
and link parameters whereas Raptor V1 supports that as well as a
script <code>raptor-config</code>. The recommended linking approach
is now as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  cc -o prog prog.c  `pkg-config raptor2 --cflags` `pkg-config raptor2 --libs`
</pre>
<p>Shown here as a compile in link all in one line but you typically
split that into two stages.
</p>
<pre>
  cc -c `pkg-config raptor2 --cflags` raptor-module.c
  ...
  cc -o prog raptor-module.c ... other modules ... `pkg-config raptor2 --libs`
</pre>


<h2>Code changes</h2>

<p>There are significant API changes, which are described in the
<a href="RELEASE.html">Release Notes</a> in long summary form with
some background to why, in the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> in
very long form.   The reference manual contains sections describing
what was added, deleted, renamed and otherwise changed for
both the functions exported from the library, as well as the
typedefs.
</p>

<p>
see html
</p>

<p>There is no fully automatic way to handle updating the code
however there is a perl script provided in the docs directory that
renames what it can, and otherwise inserts a WARNING comment near
code that needs manual updating.  It is used like
<code>perl docs/upgrade-script.pl</code> <em>source files</em> for example</p>
<pre>
  $ perl docs/upgrade-script.pl prog.c
</pre>

<p>and then edit the file prog.c and search for WARNING</p>


<h2>Handling Raptor V1 and Raptor V2 in the same code</h2>

<p>If you need to handle both APIs in the same codebase, it is
recommended that after deciding which to use, you use the
following approach based on macros.
</p>

<p>
Create a <code>#define</code> that records the choice of which API
you want to use.  You can do this triggered on whichever
<code>raptor.h</code> is in the include path by <code>#ifdef
RAPTOR_V2_AVAILABLE</code> but that may be dangerous if both
libraries and headers are present.  Better is an application define
that is determined by a configuration step.
</p>

<p>Once the choice is made, it is recommended you convert the
code to the Raptor V2 API and then add backwards-compatible macros
for the changed functions:
</p>

<pre>
#ifdef APP_WANTS_RAPTOR_V2
/* nop */

#else
#define raptor_v2_function(arg1, arg2) raptor_v1_function(arg2, arg1, arg3)

#endif
</pre>

<p>Another approach if the Raptor code is in a separate module /
source file is to fork it and make a V2 version and then choose the
file to use at configure or build time.
</p>

<p>Either way, basing the interface on the V2 APIs makes it clear
what to remove when V1 is no longer supported.
</p>


<h2>Packaging recommendations for distributors</h2>

<p>Since Raptor V2 installs files independent from Raptor V1, it can
be given a new package name.  There are two files that are shared,
<code>rapper(1)</code> and <code>rapper.1</code> the manual page.
For packaging systems that split the files (libraries, headers, docs,
debug files) into multiple packages, these should be in a package of
their own that replace and conflict with the earlier files. (This is
what I have done with the debian packages). For packaging systems
that do not use multiple packages, you will have to either leave
these files out of the V2 package or migrate them from the V1 package
to the V2 package using dependencies to ensure there are no
conflicts.  The advantage of the V2 versions is that it means
the useful command-line utility uses the latest Raptor code.</p>
